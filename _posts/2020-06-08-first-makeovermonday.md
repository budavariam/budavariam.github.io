I've started to learn how to create Visualizations with Tableau for a few weeks now. Today I've submitted my solution to the recent [MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/) challenge (2020 #23).

I've [published it](https://public.tableau.com/profile/budavariam#!/vizhome/MMW23_v3/ResultTooltip) on Tableau Public.

It was a nice experience putting my newfound knowledge in use.
