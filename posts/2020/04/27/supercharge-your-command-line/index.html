By the end of this post I hope you’ll see how well they can work together with you.\noh-my-zsh I’ve always enjoyed tweaking my command line configurations, but usually when I needed a functionality, I had to sit down and understand my code again to figure out where to put the new logic.\nLast year I’ve found oh-my-zsh, and I felt relieved. It makes it easy to create an easily managable config, nice themes and it is easily pluginable. It has a nice community that creates and shares their work.\nMy favourite feature in it, other than its simplicity, is that zsh makes tab completion navigatable, so you can use the arrow keys to select the appropriate value that you were searching for.\nAn other great built-in command is fc, that opens up my editor and lets me edit the previous command and run it after save.\nZsh comes embedded with plugins for commonly used commands like git, docker and kubernetes. It empowers them with aliases, command prompt information, also extends their tab completion by helping with available field names and lets you browse resources.\nNew plugins can be installed usually with 2 lines of code, one of which is a git clone, the other is editing the plugins list in .zshrc. Their configuration usually means to set some environmental variables.\nfzf fzf is a general purpose command line fuzzy finder. It makes it easy to filter data by typing any part of the line.\nYou can pipe data into it, or filter file content from your disk.\nI like the recommended settings, that way it stands out, from the other lines.\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --layout=reverse --border' Autocomplete Many shells come with command history navigation helper shortcut ctrl+R, but in the past it usually confused me more than what it helped. I often ended up with history | less and the /. Plugins for the rescue!\nzsh-autosuggestions This plugin lets me see autosuggestions for my commands. It makes me feel super productive, when I need to use the same set of commands in a project in order to run, build or test it.\nWhen I start to type the commands, I can accept the suggestion with a simple right arrow click. If I need to search for a complex command there is a better way for that!\nfzf in zsh Fzf can be integrated with oh-my-zsh. It is super convenient to fuzzy search for previous commands with ctrl+R. It can find my previously typed command from just a few keystrokes.\nIt is also useful to insert file name from the current subtree with ctrl+T.\nEnhance zsh tab completion with fzf As I mentioned above, zsh comes with navigatable tab completion, but unfortunately the fzf plugin do not attach in every case. Not so long ago I’ve found a great plugin that lets you use fzf in every occasion.\nSometimes it might not be what you need, you have the option to toggle it temporarily with toggle-fzf-tab.\nMy zsh config For reference my zsh config is available here. The exciting partt is the plugins section. With only a few lines of code the plugins come alive.\nplugins=( fzf-tab # to turn it on and off: toggle-fzf-tab git zsh-autosuggestions # zsh-syntax-highlighting fzf docker kubectl kube-ps1 # to turn it on and off: kubeon/kubeoff )  In case it may be changed this is how it looks like at the time of writing.\n I’ve tried zsh-syntax-highlighting, but is did not really like long commands, or pasted code, so I turnded it off.\n","wordCount":"638","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mátyás Budavári"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2020/04/27/supercharge-your-command-line/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mátyás Budavári","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://budavariam.github.io/favicon/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://budavariam.github.io/ title="Mátyás Budavári (Alt + H)" class=site-avatar><img src=/avatar.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=70 width=70></a><div class=site-info><h1 class=site-name><a href=https://budavariam.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Mátyás Budavári (Alt + H)">Mátyás Budavári</a></h1><p class=site-description>Developer from Szeged</p></div></div><ul id=menu onscroll=menu_on_scroll()><li><a href=https://budavariam.github.io/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://budavariam.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://budavariam.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://budavariam.github.io/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><span class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></span></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Supercharge your command line</h1><div class=post-meta>April 27, 2020&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mátyás Budavári</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><div class=details>Table of Contents</div></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#oh-my-zsh aria-label=oh-my-zsh>oh-my-zsh</a></li><li><a href=#fzf aria-label=fzf>fzf</a></li><li><a href=#autocomplete aria-label=Autocomplete>Autocomplete</a><ul><li><a href=#zsh-autosuggestions aria-label=zsh-autosuggestions>zsh-autosuggestions</a></li><li><a href=#fzf-in-zsh aria-label="fzf in zsh">fzf in zsh</a></li><li><a href=#enhance-zsh-tab-completion-with-fzf aria-label="Enhance zsh tab completion with fzf">Enhance zsh tab completion with fzf</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#my-zsh-config aria-label="My zsh config">My zsh config</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>The commmand line can be your best friend during development, if you take some time to get to know its capabilities.
