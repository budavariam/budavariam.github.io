      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to write my projects in JavaScript.
Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to juggle between all of them, it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable that they&amp;rsquo;re abandoned after a while and left as they were last touched for eternity.
I bet this story feels familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s pretty common to have the Table Of Contents on the side, that follows the user&amp;rsquo;s scrolling. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to see what it takes to add it to my Hugo blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A picture is worth a thousand words. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to explain the architecture and data flows with diagrams, than with lengthy paragraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers like to stick to their text editors.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/&#34;&gt;Mermaid&lt;/a&gt; lets them create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, pie charts and many more diagrams in a declarative way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2022/04/04/organization-specific-git-config/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often need to present myself differently in git per project.
When I work on a client&amp;rsquo;s own github, and they provide me an email address,
it&amp;rsquo;s more professional, &lt;em&gt;and most of the time a requirement&lt;/em&gt;, to use it to identify myself.
Git, by default lets me specify configuration globally, or per repository.
However, with a little trick I can set it on any abstraction level I need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across situations in the past where I needed to modify a pipe just slightly.
I immediately knew how to do it imperatively but could not develop a feasible chain of *nix utilities in a reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where my knowledge of a scripting language comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;a href=&#34;https://megmerettetes.hu/&#34;&gt;OITM&lt;/a&gt; is an IT championship in Hungary,  sponsored by large tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unless you were under a rock for the past couple of days, I assume you&amp;rsquo;ve heard about log4shell.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution&#34;&gt;RCE&lt;/a&gt; exploit of the popular Java logging module &lt;a href=&#34;https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/&#34;&gt;log4j&lt;/a&gt;, that caused havoc all over the internet.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with Java for years, but I&amp;rsquo;m curious if my projects are vulnerable to this exploit. Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Hungary, around the end of the year, we usually have some mandatory transferred workdays,
when we have to work on Saturdays instead of the days around holidays.
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for companies to let their workers spend their time in a more fun way,
that&amp;rsquo;s what we did with an optional hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in my &lt;a href=&#34;../../../../2021/09/29/mssql-server-basics/&#34;&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; post, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working closely with Microsoft SQL server for a while now.
Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve found some more tricks that made my life easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve started to work with Microsoft SQL Server.
I have a pretty good founation of SQL from high school, but I&amp;rsquo;ve only used PostgreSQL so far in my carreer.
I collect the snippets I found to be the most useful ones that helped me getting started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have access to a Google Calendar, that contains the absence of all my colleagues as full day events.
I work with a mostly remote team, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s useful to know when will my teammates leave for vacation,
even if they don&amp;rsquo;t tell me many days in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a simple script, to look through the events every monday and filter the ones I&amp;rsquo;m interested in,
then send me an email report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a code where I needed to see whether the service successfully sends mails through SMTP.
I did not want to use or set up an actual mail server locally.
As is turns out Python has a oneliner to solve this situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started to run on a weekly basis in last August, I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated with the data I can collect from each run.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Strava ever since.
While I was preparing for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2021/04/05/plotly-dash-development-tips/&#34;&gt;previous post about plotly-dash&lt;/a&gt;,
I decided to dust off my knowledge by creating a simple app to visualize my heartrate data in different activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2021/04/05/plotly-dash-development-tips/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I was working on some dash-plotly applications/dashboards.
It was confusing at first, I learned a lot during that time, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my gathered experience.
The docs already contain useful information, I do not wish to repeat them.
There are many example pages in github, my goal is to collect my most visited pages here,
so it&amp;rsquo;ll be easier to start out with development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first memory with vim is in early 2010s, I was just learning git, and I messed up my repo badly,
a colleague came to help, he told me seemingly random sequence of characters to type,
and suddenly everything went back to normal. Git&amp;rsquo;s default editor was vim and I think we did an interactive rebase.
We might have just fixed it in an other way, but still it felt powerful.
Later on I saw vim books at the operators&amp;rsquo; desks, and I got really curious of what it is and how can it help my daily work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I switched between a few machines on a daily basis,
and tweaked my environments constantly.
It was a tedious task to update each of them one by one,
every time I changed configs or aliases in any of them.
I figured this has got to be easier somehow,
and found the hidden world of dotfiles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I came across a post about recommended static site generators.
I decided to reevaluate my previous choice for a blog engine.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/&#34;&gt;Gatsby.js&lt;/a&gt; before, now I wanted something new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in manual mode on multiple linux boxes simultaneously.
I have to follow logs, modify configurations and kill/start applications all at once.
I got confused pretty fast of what server am I connected to in a certain console pane, and where are my operations.
On top of that my ISP had a huge traffic hit these days, and my VPN connection dropped constantly.
I dusted off my knowledge about some tools that boosted my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I usually work with *nix systems, and I process text all the time.
This consists of CLI tool output, config file modifications and log files scanning.
These utilities make it easy to search and manipulate plaintext data.
I think they&amp;rsquo;re an essential part of any developer&amp;rsquo;s toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I use dark theme in almost all of my tools.
That make my &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_(macOS)&#34;&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; a monochrome mess.
Most of my tools have theming options, so a few months ago I decided to light things up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Have you ever needed to copy and paste multiple entries at once from a page causing you to switch back and forth?
Have you ever needed to copy the output of a program running in the terminal?
I did, and got fed up with them almost 5 years ago, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can eliminate these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I come across a rant on Twitter, that regular expressions are
confusing and hard in general. I think if you know the basic building blocks of it,
you&amp;rsquo;ll see how useful they are, and you can unleash its power in your daily coding life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with some projects that can be only used with specific versions of node/python and it&amp;rsquo;s not feasible to simply dockerize them.
Every time I switch between these projects I&amp;rsquo;d need to reinstall different versions of node/python.
That would be plain silly&amp;hellip; BUT there&amp;rsquo;s a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

of External Calls in Snowflake
I decided to look into the possibilities of running external snippets from Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago at work, I wrote a simple node.js snippet to calculate route distances in &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/#directions&#34;&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt;.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m proud, that it&amp;rsquo;s used to demonstrate how to use Mapbox calculations from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.snowflake.com/&#34;&gt;Snowflake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I wanted to have a command-line interface to generate the same output.
I loved that well-configured behavior and did not want to start from scratch. Finally, I had the time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I work on similar projects that need so little customization
I feel like I can just copy and paste it, and tweak some variables,
then create a new repo for it, and start to generate the content.
Here is where project templates come into play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For coders, there is a special kind of calendar

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I develop new web components I find it frustrating that I have to run the app,
click it through until the point I find my new visual, just to see how it behaves in a real life situation.
Unit tests are great to check whether my component does what I intended,
but styling is a whole different story.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a component preview library for React,
that is not invasive and I do not need to change my code with extra markup to make it work,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://storybook.js.org/&#34;&gt;Storybook&lt;/a&gt; does exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;ve found an awesome library, called
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js&#34;&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt;,
that lets me create slideshows in markdown format.
It has a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal&#34;&gt;VSCode plugin&lt;/a&gt;,
that is intuitive to use.
My main purpose was to create a slideshow in plaintext format, and this lib exceeded my hopes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I need to set the zoom factor in an iframe.
I knew exactly how much space should the embedded content fit into.
And the scale needs to be adjustable.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;d do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The commmand line can be your best friend during development, if you take some time to get to know its capabilities.
But even if you know what it can help you with, you can still extend it.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you some of my favourite tools, &lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt;.
By the end of this post I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll see how well they can work together with you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my opinion Emmet is an essential tool for web developers.
You can code in abbreviations that you can translate into html layouts, css styles, or even xsl transformations.
These handy shortcuts make development faster, if you know what you can use by heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

the new free and open source font of Jetbrains.
I have never used custom fonts for my developer environments, so I thought it would be a good start to give it a shot.
Long story short, it was totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have an application that logs a lot, and during development I got tired of looking through the command line for the error logs, that were hidden by other logs (that were also necessary). So I looked around what is the preferred way of handling logs nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.markdownguide.org/&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to write formatted text quickly.
It&amp;rsquo;s a plain text format that uses basic notations to add semantics to the document.
The format is widely adopted, it is a very simple and efficient tool in the hands of a developer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to &lt;strong&gt;submit a huge merge request&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;gitlab terminology&lt;/em&gt;),
that has many changes from a bunch of commits.
&lt;strong&gt;You realize that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to see some changes&lt;/strong&gt;,
but these changes are not in separate commits, so they can&amp;rsquo;t be easily reverted.
There are a lot of small changes. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to type their reverse, or copy-paste for minutes.
You want to keep the commits, not squash them together in the end.
&lt;strong&gt;What would you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
