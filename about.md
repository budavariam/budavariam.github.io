I've been working as a software developer for 6 years, mainly focusing on web development.
I love every aspect of it, from frontend code to backend code, through database queries and python/bash scripts to the CI/CD pipeline of the product.
During these years I've created many CLI tools to make development easier.
I got my MSc degree in Computer Science at University of Szeged.

In my free time, I like to extend my knowledge about technologies or tools that seems interesting.

Recently I've worked with golang, reactjs, python, bash, postgresql and kubernetes.

In the bottom bar are links to my public profiles, feel free to contact me.
