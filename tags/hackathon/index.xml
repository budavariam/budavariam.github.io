      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a post. Last weekend was a typical bridge
workday, when the company usually gives an option to work on something mind blowing and fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today was a moved working day because Hungarian national holiday 20th of August is going to be a Tuesday, and we won&amp;rsquo;t work on Monday. In our company if it&amp;rsquo;s a Saturday working day it most likely means that there is a hackathon!
This time I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a project beforehand that I could fully align with, and the one I considered joining already had a bunch of people. This time I wanted to create something, and learn new stuff.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Luckily this year had another transferred working day, and the tradition continues: our company gifted us with an opportunity to work on some fun projects in this Saturday working day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New Year, new transferred working day. Luckily we had the opportunity to do something fun in a Saturday instead of just extending our work week. So we had another Hackathon! 游꿀&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Hungary, around the end of the year, we usually have some mandatory transferred workdays,
when we have to work on Saturdays instead of the days around holidays.
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for companies to let their workers spend their time in a more fun way,
that&amp;rsquo;s what we did with an optional hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
