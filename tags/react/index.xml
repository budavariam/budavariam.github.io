      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I tried Github actions to deploy some of my static sites, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite happy with its capabilities.
Let me share my configs for different kinds of setups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Plotly Dash Development Tips</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I was working on some dash-plotly applications/dashboards.
It was confusing at first, I learned a lot during that time, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my gathered experience.
The docs already contain useful information, I do not wish to repeat them.
There are many example pages in github, my goal is to collect my most visited pages here,
so it&amp;rsquo;ll be easier to start out with development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition&#34;&gt;React Transition group&lt;/a&gt; is a great library for animations in react.
I want to share my experience on how to have an appear animation on components that are mounted with an &lt;code&gt;in={false}&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
