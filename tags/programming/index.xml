      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a tiling window manager and AI companion in iTerm2.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a post.
In the past few days I stumbled upon a few fascinating things that
I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for for a while now and I wanted to share it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time of the year that I&amp;rsquo;m preparing to share my knowledge arcoss the company.
I tend to forget the goodies that worked for me I&amp;rsquo;ll collect them here to simplify my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to write my projects in JavaScript.
Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to juggle between all of them, it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable that they&amp;rsquo;re abandoned after a while and left as they were last touched for eternity.
I bet this story feels familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I usually work with *nix systems, and I process text all the time.
This consists of CLI tool output, config file modifications and log files scanning.
These utilities make it easy to search and manipulate plaintext data.
I think they&amp;rsquo;re an essential part of any developer&amp;rsquo;s toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Regular Expressions Are Awesome</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I come across a rant on Twitter, that regular expressions are
confusing and hard in general. I think if you know the basic building blocks of it,
you&amp;rsquo;ll see how useful they are, and you can unleash its power in your daily coding life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2021/01/11/node/python-version-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with some projects that can be only used with specific versions of node/python and it&amp;rsquo;s not feasible to simply dockerize them.
Every time I switch between these projects I&amp;rsquo;d need to reinstall different versions of node/python.
That would be plain silly&amp;hellip; BUT there&amp;rsquo;s a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

of External Calls in Snowflake
I decided to look into the possibilities of running external snippets from Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago at work, I wrote a simple node.js snippet to calculate route distances in &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/#directions&#34;&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt;.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m proud, that it&amp;rsquo;s used to demonstrate how to use Mapbox calculations from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.snowflake.com/&#34;&gt;Snowflake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2020/06/01/markdown-slideshow/&#34;&gt;VSCode Reveal&lt;/a&gt;,
I wanted to have a command-line interface to generate the same output.
I loved that well-configured behavior and did not want to start from scratch. Finally, I had the time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I work on similar projects that need so little customization
I feel like I can just copy and paste it, and tweak some variables,
then create a new repo for it, and start to generate the content.
Here is where project templates come into play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the time of the year when many people start to countdown with their advent calendars.
For coders, there is a special kind of calendar
that keeps us busy and help us prepare for the celebration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2020/07/04/storybook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I develop new web components I find it frustrating that I have to run the app,
click it through until the point I find my new visual, just to see how it behaves in a real life situation.
Unit tests are great to check whether my component does what I intended,
but styling is a whole different story.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a component preview library for React,
that is not invasive and I do not need to change my code with extra markup to make it work,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://storybook.js.org/&#34;&gt;Storybook&lt;/a&gt; does exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition&#34;&gt;React Transition group&lt;/a&gt; is a great library for animations in react.
I want to share my experience on how to have an appear animation on components that are mounted with an &lt;code&gt;in={false}&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I need to set the zoom factor in an iframe.
I knew exactly how much space should the embedded content fit into.
And the scale needs to be adjustable.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;d do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The commmand line can be your best friend during development, if you take some time to get to know its capabilities.
But even if you know what it can help you with, you can still extend it.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you some of my favourite tools, &lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt;.
By the end of this post I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll see how well they can work together with you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my opinion Emmet is an essential tool for web developers.
You can code in abbreviations that you can translate into html layouts, css styles, or even xsl transformations.
These handy shortcuts make development faster, if you know what you can use by heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I came across a tweet about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/&#34;&gt;Jetbrains Mono&lt;/a&gt;,
the new free and open source font of Jetbrains.
I have never used custom fonts for my developer environments, so I thought it would be a good start to give it a shot.
Long story short, it was totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have an application that logs a lot, and during development I got tired of looking through the command line for the error logs, that were hidden by other logs (that were also necessary). So I looked around what is the preferred way of handling logs nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to &lt;strong&gt;submit a huge merge request&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;gitlab terminology&lt;/em&gt;),
that has many changes from a bunch of commits.
&lt;strong&gt;You realize that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to see some changes&lt;/strong&gt;,
but these changes are not in separate commits, so they can&amp;rsquo;t be easily reverted.
There are a lot of small changes. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to type their reverse, or copy-paste for minutes.
You want to keep the commits, not squash them together in the end.
&lt;strong&gt;What would you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking whether there&amp;rsquo;s a more interactive way of learning flexbox, rather than &lt;a href=&#34;https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/&#34;&gt;this great guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
