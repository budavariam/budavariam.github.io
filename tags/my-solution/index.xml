      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, I became familiar with &lt;a href=&#34;https://lit.dev/&#34;&gt;LitElement&lt;/a&gt;.
I love the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lit.dev/docs/tools/starter-kits/&#34;&gt;starter kit&lt;/a&gt;, but I hate to start up the manual build tasks.
Nowadays, I work with VSCode a lost, so I tried to devise a convenient vendor locked-in solution for a change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://cssbattle.dev&#34;&gt;CSS Battle&lt;/a&gt; last year. I tried code golfs before, but this is a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a situation where you work for a few repositories over a prolonged time, and all of a sudden, you&amp;rsquo;re notified that you&amp;rsquo;ll no longer have access to these repos in a few weeks?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have access to a Google Calendar, that contains the absence of all my colleagues as full day events.
I work with a mostly remote team, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s useful to know when will my teammates leave for vacation,
even if they don&amp;rsquo;t tell me many days in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a simple script, to look through the events every monday and filter the ones I&amp;rsquo;m interested in,
then send me an email report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I tried Github actions to deploy some of my static sites, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite happy with its capabilities.
Let me share my configs for different kinds of setups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2020/06/01/markdown-slideshow/&#34;&gt;VSCode Reveal&lt;/a&gt;,
I wanted to have a command-line interface to generate the same output.
I loved that well-configured behavior and did not want to start from scratch. Finally, I had the time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the time of the year when many people start to countdown with their advent calendars.
For coders, there is a special kind of calendar
that keeps us busy and help us prepare for the celebration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition&#34;&gt;React Transition group&lt;/a&gt; is a great library for animations in react.
I want to share my experience on how to have an appear animation on components that are mounted with an &lt;code&gt;in={false}&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started to learn how to create Visualizations with Tableau for a few weeks now. Today I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted my solution to the recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/&#34;&gt;MakeoverMonday&lt;/a&gt; challenge (2020 #23).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I need to set the zoom factor in an iframe.
I knew exactly how much space should the embedded content fit into.
And the scale needs to be adjustable.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;d do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Groom merge request</title>
      <link>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2019/04/25/groom-merge-request/</link>

      <guid>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2019/04/25/groom-merge-request/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to &lt;strong&gt;submit a huge merge request&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;gitlab terminology&lt;/em&gt;),
that has many changes from a bunch of commits.
&lt;strong&gt;You realize that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to see some changes&lt;/strong&gt;,
but these changes are not in separate commits, so they can&amp;rsquo;t be easily reverted.
There are a lot of small changes. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to type their reverse, or copy-paste for minutes.
You want to keep the commits, not squash them together in the end.
&lt;strong&gt;What would you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
