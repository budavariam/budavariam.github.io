      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first memory with vim is in early 2010s, I was just learning git, and I messed up my repo badly,
a colleague came to help, he told me seemingly random sequence of characters to type,
and suddenly everything went back to normal. Git&amp;rsquo;s default editor was vim and I think we did an interactive rebase.
We might have just fixed it in an other way, but still it felt powerful.
Later on I saw vim books at the operators&#39; desks, and I got really curious of what it is and how can it help my daily work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
