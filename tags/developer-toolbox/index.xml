      <title>Think Outside The Box</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in manual mode on multiple linux boxes simultaneously.
I have to follow logs, modify configurations and kill/start applications all at once.
I got confused pretty fast of what server am I connected to in a certain console pane, and where are my operations.
On top of that my ISP had a huge traffic hit these days, and my VPN connection dropped constantly.
I dusted off my knowledge about some tools that boosted my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I usually work with *nix systems, and I process text all the time.
This consists of CLI tool output, config file modifications and log files scanning.
These utilities make it easy to search and manipulate plaintext data.
I think they&amp;rsquo;re an essential part of any developer&amp;rsquo;s toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever typed ctrl-c instead of ctrl-v and had to recopy again?
Have you ever needed to copy and paste multiple entries at once from a page causing you to switch back and forth?
Have you ever needed to copy the output of a program running in the terminal?
I did, and got fed up with them almost 5 years ago, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can eliminate these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Regular Expressions Are Awesome</title>
      <link>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2021/01/18/regular-expressions-are-awesome/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I come across a rant on Twitter, that regular expressions are
confusing and hard in general. I think if you know the basic building blocks of it,
you&amp;rsquo;ll see how useful they are, and you can unleash its power in your daily coding life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Node/Python Version Management</title>
      <link>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2021/01/11/node/python-version-management/</link>

      <guid>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2021/01/11/node/python-version-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with some projects that can be only used with specific versions of node/python and it&amp;rsquo;s not feasible to simply dockerize them.
Every time I switch between these projects I&amp;rsquo;d need to reinstall different versions of node/python.
That would be plain silly&amp;hellip; BUT there&amp;rsquo;s a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I read a question in twitter, what is the thing that you wish you had known when you started to code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Supercharge your command line</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The commmand line can be your best friend during development, if you take some time to get to know its capabilities.
But even if you know what it can help you with, you can still extend it.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you some of my favourite tools, &lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt;. By the end of this post I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll see how well they can work together with you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Developer font</title>
      <link>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2020/02/08/developer-font/</link>

      <guid>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2020/02/08/developer-font/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I came across a tweet about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/&#34;&gt;Jetbrains Mono&lt;/a&gt;,
the new free and open source font of Jetbrains.
I have never used custom fonts for my developer environments, so I thought it would be a good start to give it a shot.
Long story short, it was totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Plaintext Docs In Markdown</title>
      <link>https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2019/05/01/plaintext-docs-in-markdown/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.markdownguide.org/&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to write formatted text quickly.
It&amp;rsquo;s a plain text format that uses basic notations to add semantics to the document.
The format is widely adopted, it is a very simple and efficient tool in the hands of a developer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
