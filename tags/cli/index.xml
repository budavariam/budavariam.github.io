      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across situations in the past where I needed to modify a pipe just slightly.
I immediately knew how to do it imperatively but could not develop a feasible chain of *nix utilities in a reasonable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where my knowledge of a scripting language comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever typed ctrl-c instead of ctrl-v and had to recopy again?
Have you ever needed to copy and paste multiple entries at once from a page causing you to switch back and forth?
Have you ever needed to copy the output of a program running in the terminal?
I did, and got fed up with them almost 5 years ago, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can eliminate these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://budavariam.github.io/posts/2020/06/01/markdown-slideshow/&#34;&gt;VSCode Reveal&lt;/a&gt;,
I wanted to have a command-line interface to generate the same output.
I loved that well-configured behavior and did not want to start from scratch. Finally, I had the time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The commmand line can be your best friend during development, if you take some time to get to know its capabilities.
But even if you know what it can help you with, you can still extend it.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you some of my favourite tools, &lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt;.
By the end of this post I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll see how well they can work together with you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
