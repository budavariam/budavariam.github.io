      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I listened to the Art of Manliness podcast ep. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/habits/7-journaling-techniques-that-can-change-your-life/&#34;&gt;#867&lt;/a&gt; about journaling techniques that could change your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really resonated with me, and got me thinking about doing something about my bad habits and stepping on the path I&amp;rsquo;d like to walk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keep Your Configs Safe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I switched between a few machines on a daily basis,
and tweaked my environments constantly.
It was a tedious task to update each of them one by one,
every time I changed configs or aliases in any of them.
I figured this has got to be easier somehow,
and found the hidden world of dotfiles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in manual mode on multiple linux boxes simultaneously.
I have to follow logs, modify configurations and kill/start applications all at once.
I got confused pretty fast of what server am I connected to in a certain console pane, and where are my operations.
On top of that my ISP had a huge traffic hit these days, and my VPN connection dropped constantly.
I dusted off my knowledge about some tools that boosted my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently following the trends with my dev setup.
I use dark theme in almost all of my tools.
That make my &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_(macOS)&#34;&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; a monochrome mess.
Most of my tools have theming options, so a few months ago I decided to light things up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever typed ctrl-c instead of ctrl-v and had to recopy again?
Have you ever needed to copy and paste multiple entries at once from a page causing you to switch back and forth?
Have you ever needed to copy the output of a program running in the terminal?
I did, and got fed up with them almost 5 years ago, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can eliminate these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
