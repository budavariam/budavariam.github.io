I started to run on a weekly basis in last August, I'm fascinated with the data I can collect from each run.
I've been using Strava ever since.
While I was preparing for my [previous post about plotly-dash](/posts/2021/04/05/plotly-dash-development-tips/),
I decided to dust off my knowledge by creating a simple app to visualize my heartrate data in different activities.
