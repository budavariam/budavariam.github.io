The [6th OITM](https://megmerettetes.hu/archivum/vi-orszagos-it-megmerettetes/) has just finished for me.
[OITM](https://megmerettetes.hu/) is an IT championship in Hungary, sponsored by large tech companies held in November for 7 rounds.

<!--more-->

The current championship had `29` challenges across different fields.
Every week there's a new round. This year I participated in `17` categories.

## How I felt

I needed to put in way more time than what I expected.

This year I needed some weeks to get into it and at the end I felt bad about not taking it more seriously earlier.

It took me a while to get over my disappointment in last year's award ceremony
and push myself to learn something new in the categories.

My favorite categories were the `Cloud BI`, where I realized I know more about BI then what I thought.

And `React.js`, because it made me feel good about how much I already know, while pointing out the new directions that I could learn in it.

2 years ago my favourite category was Cybersecurity,
this year that was the one I enjoyed the least, and even stopped participating.
After looking at the categories I think I should have joined to IT Security, that would have been probably what I missed.

I deliberately hadn't participated in categories where I knew I would fail badly like Microsoft related categories, php or Effective Java.

## What Changed

This year the organizers started to give out badges for _point over the average_, _time below the average_ and _flawless round_.
Also they gave out coupons for each category winners each week.

I liked that there was a new category for `Excel`, and that now many categories stopped sending out 4 answer guess forms.

## Results

I earned these badges, that are currently visible on [my profile](https://app.megmerettetes.hu/adatlap/36f5d827-d986-4f64-ad08-7387a2274e50).

- 1x Category champion (Cloud BI)
- 60/119 rounds I scored over the average point of all participants
- 56/119 rounds I finished earlier than the average of all participants
- 12/119 flawless rounds

Here are what I know about my results as of now for this year ordered by Percentage:
