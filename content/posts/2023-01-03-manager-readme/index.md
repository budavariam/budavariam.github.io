As the new year approached I wanted to write a Team Leader manifesto, or a document to catch how it feels to be a team lead after one year.
To summarize what I learned or to help new team leaders with what to expect.

I found this Manager Readme format and wanted to try it out.

<!--more-->

You can find the basic doc here at [managerreadme.com](https://managerreadme.com/).

Name: Mátyás
Leader since: 2021 Sept
Company: Starschema ltd.
Title: Senior Software Developer Team Lead

## Motivation for this document

### Why did I take the time to write this document?

This document is my team lead manifesto as of 2022.
I write it in first person as a teamlead, and I write it to You as if you'd join my team soon.
It's like a discussion, this is how I'd tell it to you if we meet up.

I heard about this format in a hungarian podcast called ['Anonim Vezetők Klubja'](https://avkpodcast.hu/) ep s01e07.
It seemed interesting enough to try it out.

### What were I aimed to get from others reading it?

I wanted you to get a sense of how I "work" and what working with me can feel like.

Also I wanted to remind myself of all my bad and good quirks that I should mention to avoid surprises.

## My role

Besides my software development roles, my main role as a teamlead includes these areas:

- `Administration`: Manage newcomers, leavers, changes, timesheets, accesses
- `Knowledge Management`: What you should know, what should I know
- `Resource Management`: What projects will you work on
- `Performance management`: Provide feedback
- `Career planning/Development plan`: Discuss options and goals
- `Recruitment`: Choose the new candidates to my team

### What are the team's KPIs? How are you being measured?

We mostly work in consulting, so the clients pay for our time.
Basically the sooner you finish the tasks the better you are in this metric.

In this sense it makes you more valuable if you can estimate how much time it'd take you to finish a task.
It's even better if you could estimate something that you haven't done before, of course I know it's a dream.

### How will I help my teammates get better at their jobs?

I'll be there for technical problem debugging and can refer tutorials or trainings.

I'm up to jumping in calls for hard technical problems to debug them together.
You can join me on my tasks to work them through to get a glimpse on how I work.

## What do I value most?

I value attention to details, it'll make me happy if you bring up that you thought about edge cases as well.

I believe that we are humans and we make mistakes,
I value when people come forward with their mistakes before they are evident.

I value proactivity, I don't want to nudge you to tell me how you're doing.
If we're working on time-sensitive tasks keep me posted.

I value humility for the tasks and projects and when people can argue on a 
technical level and does not take it personally when their ideas are not the one that the team chooses to implement.

I value ideas that make things better.

### What does helping me look like?

You can help me by asking the right questions, come up with new ideas that we can implement together.

I can help you by managing conflicts, give you technical help via screensharing and educate you in topics in which I know more.

### What is my process for handling conflicts? (and how you can do it yourself)

Write me on slack and we'll figure it out.

I'll most likely ask these questions:

- Does the other party know about this issue?
- Did you listen to their point of view?
- How did you try to resolve it?

### What weaknesses of mine should the team know about, and how can they help me improve?

I studied Computer Science at the university,
I worked for 7 years professionally in a developer role before I got a managing role.

I'm stil learning communication and management. Please be patient with me, I'm still learning.

## My Expectations

### How should people set time with me?

- If you want me in a meeting please tell me in advance at least 2 hours ahead, best way is on slack.
- I don't want to have a meeting during my lunch break or way after work hours.
- For ad-hoc help ping me on slack and I'll tell when I'm available.
- My calendar is up to date with personal slots booked as well, you can book a time there with confidence.
- Please don't book between 2 slots that have 30 mins between them, or let me know in advance.
- If you send me a calendar invitation please give me context in a few sentences or make a descriptive title that I can remember if we discussed it earlier
- Please don't set up a meeting where you tell 5+ people what we need to figure out on the spot, let us prepare

### When it comes to mistakes, what's the best way for employees to come forward?

Write me on slack that there's a problem and describe it in a short sentence
(so that I won't get a heart attack until the explanation).
After that, we can jump on a call where we can figure out how can we solve the issue.

### How do I define "Done"?

- The happy path works flawlessly.
- The error paths let the user know what's wrong.
- You demonstrate that you thought about edge cases even if they're not implemented yet.
- It's demoable to the user without shame.
- There's some kind of documentation or way to demonstrate it with example input to use.

### When should people be available and how?

For cooperation it's best if you're available during regular work hours in Europe.
If you need to leave for at least 2 hours please let me know, so that I know that you're away.
I expect to communicate in a heavily async way so it does not matter when you answer.
If there's something complex/urgent than we can jump on a call but I prefer detailed text messages.

I won't bother you via telephone, unless there's a special on-call agreement, it's your shift, and something related is going on.

Email chains are the worst way to communicate with me.

## 1:1s

## What are 1:1s?

One on ones are a schedules formal way to have a friendly discussion.

I don't want you to wait for them to tell me anything.
Ping me on slack and we can have a discussion whenever.

### When do I usually have 1:1s with my team?

I like to have 1:1 sessions in the morning before getting into work.
If it's up to me I'll schedule at most 3 of them in a row, close to each other with 15 minute breaks.

I like 1:1 sessions to last for at least 30 minutes and I prefer to hold them once in 2 weeks.

We can postpone the original schedule but don't cancel it (unless there's a long vacation or similar).

### Who should lead the 1:1?

As you prefer, I'll prepare for our meetings with a basic agenda if there's anything that we ought to talk about.

Otherwise it's up to you how much you'd like to share.

This meeting is about confidential talking and bonding.

If there's anything I'd like to share with others I'll ask it explicitly.

### What to expect on a 1:1?

I'll most likely ask you how do you feel and what would you like to talk about.
Also if there's anything you're proud of that you'd like to share, what is blocking you, how can I support you.

Also I usually prepare some topics beforehand as an agenda if it's applicable

- feedback from others
- company/work related things to discuss
- project related things to discuss
- personal growth

I like to take notes to expand my memory, and to mark down the action items of what we discuss.
This makes me feel safer that I can come back with answers to you at most the next time.

### What should be the main focus during that time?

You.

I don't want to take a lead and bore you with my stories.
I'm interested in how you feel, what you struggle with and how can I help.

## Personality quirks

### What are the individual quirks that anyone working with me should know about?

- I hate cold starts. [#TeamNoHello](https://nohello.net/en/).
- If you believe in personality tests I got blue and green, for me it means that I prefer to talk about technical stuff and I want to support you.
- I don't like to repeat myself, if I ask something to do I'll expect that you at least write it down to remember it.
  I'll remind you of it occasionally in a nice tone, but it'll make our work together more seemless if you remember it, and you'll grow in my eye.
- I'll try to make sure that there are no elephants in the room, if we discuss something that only half of the team does not know about, I'll give them context in a few sentences. I'll expect the same, please keep me in the loop while I'm on vacation, write me anything it'll make my catchup easier when I get back from it. I won't read it while I'm away.
- I don't like firefighting mentality. I'll try to be one step ahead of the team, and I prefer dealing with issues earlier than they really become a burning issue
- I don't like micromanagement, I believe that you'll ask questions if you get stuck for at least an hour.
- I'm extremely polite, so it might not be evident when I'm pissed off. If I shout you'll know that I'm super mad.

## Where to focus on your first 90 days?

### What does effective onboarding look like on my team?

We have a few-week long onboarding program, that dives you deep into our workdays into real projects.
You can work with a single colleague for an extended period of time
to bond and see how workin on the projects together feel like.

It's considered effective if you have a better understanding of who we are, what we do, and how we like to do it.

### How can you tell if you're doing a good job in your first 30 days?

You ask a lot of questions.
You fit with the team personally and you feel with most of tham that you can work together effectively.

## Disclaimer

This document captures how I feel currently, I might not update it regularly.

Being a leader is a journey for me, I might have a complete mental shift later.

Happy leading!
