The [7th OITM](https://megmerettetes.hu/archivum/vi-orszagos-it-megmerettetes/) has just finished for me.
[OITM](https://megmerettetes.hu/) is an IT championship in Hungary, sponsored by large tech companies held in November for 7 rounds.

<!--more-->

The current championship had `23` challenging categories across different fields.
Every week there's a new round. This year I participated in `15` categories.

## How I felt

I haven't learned from past years, and applied for way more categories than I should have. 
It resulted in almost burning myself out, doing the tasks without much consideration and just drilled some categories to get to the end. 

This year I should have unsubscribed from the categories that were too complex and I did not have a clue about them, I might have felt better about this contest then. 

I still could put in all my energy into this contest as during the solutions I was constantly thinking about how many people would find their way to trick their points like using LLMs or friends or double accounts (as the organizers pointed out...) 

Although I really liked to be challenged in the categories I actually know about. 

My favorite category was still the `Cloud BI`, there are a bunch of things for me to learn and I love that area.
I started to get into iot and smart homes andI love that I got to learn about industrial networks and mqtt. 

I did not like that some categories used external sites that maybe worked maybe not, there were features that they expected to be there that were gone by the time the categories went live. 
Cyber security had a CTF again, I failed that miserably. 

## What Changed

This year the organizers gave the possibility for companies to compete with each other. 
I'd be interested in to see a leaderboard from within the company. 

I like that the caregories keep up with the trends and there was a new category for large lanhguage models.

This year the organizers brought back the strict time limited rounds at the end. 
People had mixed feelings about them, luckily I did not have planned activities. 

## Results

I earned these badges, that are currently visible on [my profile](https://app.megmerettetes.hu/adatlap/36f5d827-d986-4f64-ad08-7387a2274e50).
