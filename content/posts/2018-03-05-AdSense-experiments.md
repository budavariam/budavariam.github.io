This page is an easter egg, mostly for my development purposes.

<!--more-->

I just started to try out a few new things around 2022-06-09.
I fired up AdSense and started to learn more about Google Analytics.

## Libs I Use for my Site

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for static site generation
- My customized [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/budavariam/hugo-PaperMod/tree/budavariam)

## Dashboards I Use

### Performance

- Lighthouse test in Chrome (open in DevTools). [Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
- [PageSpeed webDev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbudavariam.github.io%2F&form_factor=mobile)

### Analytics

- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/).
  - [Analytics Docs](https://developers.google.com/analytics)
- [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/).
  - [AdSense Getting Started](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/)
- [Google Search console](https://search.google.com/search-console?utm_source=about-page&resource_id=https://budavariam.github.io/). 
  - [Google Search Central Docs](https://developers.google.com/search)

## AD Layout Test

Here's my playground to try out how the ads look like.
I like to have a centralized place to see how dark mode behaves.
How width, height, borders and custom colors when I modify them in the website.

Feel free to move on...

### AdDisplay

How ads look like as display.
