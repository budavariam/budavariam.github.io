I just started to get to know how ads work, I'm going to experiment with the different capabilities of Google AdSense and how it can be connected with Google Analytics.

<!--more-->

I fired up AdSense and started to learn more about Google Analytics v4.
I've used Google Analytics v3 (Universal Analytics) before, but it's [going to be deprecated](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en) next year.
They wrote a [blog post](https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/prepare-for-future-with-google-analytics-4/?utm_campaign=2022-q1-gbl-all-gafree) about it as well.

## Libs I Use for my Site

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for static site generation
- My customized [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/budavariam/hugo-PaperMod/tree/budavariam)
