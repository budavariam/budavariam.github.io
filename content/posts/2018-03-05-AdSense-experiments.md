This page is an easter egg, mostly for my development purposes.

I just started to try out a few new things around 2022-06-09.
I fired up AdSense and started to learn more about Google Analytics.

## Libs I Use for my Site

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for static site generation
- My customized [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/budavariam/hugo-PaperMod/tree/budavariam)

## Dashboards I Use

### Performance

- Lighthouse test in Chrome (open in DevTools). [Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
- [PageSpeed webDev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbudavariam.github.io%2F&form_factor=mobile)

### Analytics

- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/).
  - [Analytics Docs](https://developers.google.com/analytics)
