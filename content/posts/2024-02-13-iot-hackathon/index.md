We participatted in a month long IoT hackathon with my colleagues.

We aimed to create a sun following solar panel, and measure the efficiency of different methods.
we had a profile for no movement, manual movement with a joystick, light following with photoresistors and light following with sun position calculation.

## Microcontroller

## Tech stack

Docker
Grafana
InfluxDb

## Share code

- We leveraged config to determine whether we are running code from the device or the local docker environment

## Sensors we used


## Micropython

## Rewrite the modules in python

## How to calculate the sun position

## Calibrate the compass

## Takeaway from the demo

- We need to think backwards, and focus on what we are going to present, and develop it with priority
- It does not matter if the things does not work as long as you have a nice presentation
