The 4th OITM has finished.
[OITM](https://megmerettetes.hu/) is an IT championship in Hungary sponsored by large tech companies.

<!--more-->

The current championship had 22 categories, that had rounds every week. I participated in 7 categories.
I learned from past years, that it's harder to stick with completing all tests weekly if I'm not familiar with the topic at all.

This year I finally get to the end!
I enjoyed participating. I could have prepared more, but I'm happy with the end result.

I learned about the nuances of many fields.
The questions helped me refresh my knowledge on topics I don't use in my day-to-day work.
