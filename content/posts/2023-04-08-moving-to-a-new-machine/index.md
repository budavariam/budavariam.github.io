I like to set up certain things when I move to a new machine.

## Configuration Files

I set up my dotfiles. As I wrote in my previous post [Keep Your Configs Safe](../../../../2021/03/06/keep-your-configs-safe#dotfiles)

## Operating System Configuration

- Speed up the trackpad, mouse, keyboard navigation to as fast as I can
- Remap CapsLock to esc
- Setup English layout for coding and Hungarian layout for accents
- Remap annoying shortcuts:
  - cmd+q - Invert screen colors

## Preferred VSCode Extensions

- GitLens
- Peacock
- ShellCheck
- Gremlins tracker
