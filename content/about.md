I've been working as a software developer since 2014, mainly focusing on web development.
I love development and automation. From frontend code to backend code, through database queries and python/bash scripts to the CI/CD pipeline of the product.

I learned HTML at an early age. I started with Excel macros, SQL, and Pascal in high school.
I got my MSc degree in Computer Science at the [University of Szeged](https://u-szeged.hu/) in Software Development faculty.

In my free time, I like to extend my knowledge about technologies or tools that seem interesting.

Nowadays, I work with golang, react.js, python, bash, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes.

Here are links to my public profiles. Feel free to reach out!
